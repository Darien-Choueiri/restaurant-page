# restaurant-page

In this project I create a restaurant page, complete with a menu, contact page, and homepage. 

This is my first project using webpack during development. I practiced the essentials of webpack development using source maps, various development modes, and learning how to manage assests using webpack.

This is also the first project where I have the bulk of my HTML in a seperate js files. This povided an interesting opportunity to utilize classes a lot more to reduce repeating code for things such as menu items and contact information for employees.
